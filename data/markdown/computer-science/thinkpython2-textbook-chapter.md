Now that we know how to create new types, the next step is to write functions that take
programmer-defined objects as parameters and return them as results. In this chapter I
alsopresent“functionalprogrammingstyle”andtwonewprogramdevelopmentplans.

As another example of a programmer-defined type, we’ll define a class called that

class Time:
| """Represents | the time      | of day. |     |

| attributes:   | hour, minute, | second  |     |

WecancreateanewTimeobjectandassignattributesforhours,minutes,andseconds:
time = Time()
| time.hour = | 11   |     |     |

| time.minute | = 59 |     |     |
| time.second | = 30 |     |     |

Inthenextfewsections,we’llwritetwofunctionsthataddtimevalues. Theydemonstrate
two kinds of functions: pure functions and modifiers. They also demonstrate a develop-

Hereisasimpleprototypeofadd_time:
| def add_time(t1, | t2):        |             |     |     |
| ---------------- | ----------- | ----------- | --- | --- |
| sum              | = Time()    |             |     |     |
| sum.hour         | = t1.hour   | + t2.hour   |     |     |
| sum.minute       | = t1.minute | + t2.minute |     |     |
| sum.second       | = t1.second | + t2.second |     |     |

| >>> done            | = add_time(start, | duration) |     |     |
>>> print_time(done)
10:80:00
10:80:00
The result, might not be what you were hoping for. The problem is that this
function does not deal with cases where the number of seconds or minutes adds up to
morethansixty. Whenthathappens,wehaveto“carry”theextrasecondsintotheminute
columnortheextraminutesintothehourcolumn.

less than sixty. One solution is to replace the statements with statements. That
would make the function correct, but not very efficient. As an exercise, write a correct
versionofincrementthatdoesn’tcontainanyloops.
Anything that can be done with modifiers can also be done with pure functions. In fact,
some programming languages only allow pure functions. There is some evidence that
programsthatusepurefunctionsarefastertodevelopandlesserror-pronethanprograms
thatusemodifiers. Butmodifiersareconvenientattimes,andfunctionalprogramstendto

| --- | --- | --- | ---------- | ------------------- |
Ingeneral,Irecommendthatyouwritepurefunctionswheneveritisreasonableandresort
to modifiers only if there is a compelling advantage. This approach might be called a
functionalprogrammingstyle.
As an exercise, write a “pure” version of increment that creates and returns a new Time
objectratherthanmodifyingtheparameter.

| ---------------- | --- | --------------- | --- | --- |
ThedevelopmentplanIamdemonstratingiscalled“prototypeandpatch”. Foreachfunc-
tion,Iwroteaprototypethatperformedthebasiccalculationandthentestedit,patching
errorsalongtheway.
This approach can be effective, especially if you don’t yet have a deep understanding
of the problem. But incremental corrections can generate code that is unnecessarily
complicated—since it deals with many special cases—and unreliable—since it is hard to
knowifyouhavefoundalltheerrors.

Whenwewroteadd_timeandincrement,

Thisobservationsuggestsanotherapproachtothewholeproblem—wecanconvertTime
objects to integers and take advantage of the fact that the computer knows how to do
integerarithmetic.
HereisafunctionthatconvertsTimestointegers:
def time_to_int(time):
| minutes | = time.hour | * 60 + time.minute |     |     |
| ------- | ----------- | ------------------ | --- | --- |
| seconds | = minutes   | * 60 + time.second |     |     |

| ---------- | ----------- | ----------------- | --- | --- |
| minutes,   | time.second | = divmod(seconds, | 60) |     |
| time.hour, | time.minute | = divmod(minutes, | 60) |     |

16.5. Debugging 159
This version is shorter than the original, and easier to verify. As an exercise, rewrite
incrementusingtime_to_intandint_to_time.
Insomeways,convertingfrombase60tobase10andbackisharderthanjustdealingwith
times.Baseconversionismoreabstract;ourintuitionfordealingwithtimevaluesisbetter.
But if we have the insight to treat times as base 60 numbers and make the investment of
