12.4 Integrated Rate Laws

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

•  Explain the form and function of an integrated rate law
•  Perform integrated rate law calculations for zero-, first-, and second-order reactions
•  Define half-life and carry out related calculations
•  Identify the order of a reaction from concentration/time data

The rate laws discussed thus far relate the rate and the concentrations of reactants. We can also determine a
second form of each rate law that relates the concentrations of reactants and time. These are called integrated rate
laws. We can use an integrated rate law to determine the amount of reactant or product present after a period of
time or to estimate the time required for a reaction to proceed to a certain extent. For example, an integrated rate
law is used to determine the length of time a radioactive material must be stored for its radioactivity to decay to a
safe level.

Using calculus, the differential rate law for a chemical reaction can be integrated with respect to time to give an
equation that relates the amount of reactant or product present in a reaction mixture to the elapsed time of the
reaction. This process can either be very straightforward or very complex, depending on the complexity of the
differential rate law. For purposes of discussion, we will focus on the resulting integrated rate laws for first-, second-
, and zero-order reactions.

First-Order Reactions

Integration of the rate law for a simple first-order reaction (rate = k[A]) results in an equation describing how the
reactant concentration varies with time:

where [A]t is the concentration of A at any time t, [A]0 is the initial concentration of A, and k is the first-order rate
constant.

For mathematical convenience, this equation may be rearranged to other formats, including direct and indirect
proportionalities:

and a format showing a linear dependence of concentration in time:

The Integrated Rate Law for a First-Order Reaction

 10−3 s−1:

How long will it take for 80.0% of a sample of C4H8 to decompose?

Solution

Since the relative change in reactant concentration is provided, a convenient format for the integrated rate law is:

The initial concentration of C4H8, [A]0, is not provided, but the provision that 80.0% of the sample has decomposed
is enough information to solve this problem. Let x be the initial concentration, in which case the concentration after
80.0% decomposition is 20.0% of x or 0.200x. Rearranging the rate law to isolate t and substituting the provided

Answer:

16.7 days

In the next example exercise, a linear format for the integrated rate law will be convenient:

A plot of ln[A]t versus t for a first-order reaction is a straight line with a slope of −k and a y-intercept of ln[A]0. If a set
of rate data are plotted in this fashion but do not result in a straight line, the reaction is not first order in A.

FIGURE 12.9 A linear relationship between ln[H2O2] and time suggests the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide is a first-order reaction.

The plot of ln[H2O2] versus time is linear, indicating that the reaction may be described by a first-order rate law.

According to the linear format of the first-order integrated rate law, the rate constant is given by the negative of this
plot’s slope.

The slope of this line may be derived from two values of ln[H2O2] at different values of t (one near each end of the
line is preferable). For example, the value of ln[H2O2] when t is 0.00 h is 0.000; the value when t = 24.00 h is −2.772

Second-Order Reactions

The equations that relate the concentrations of reactants and the rate constant of second-order reactions can be
fairly complicated. To illustrate the point with minimal complexity, only the simplest second-order reactions will be
described here, namely, those whose rates depend on the concentration of just one reactant. For these types of
reactions, the differential rate law is written as:

For these second-order reactions, the integrated rate law is:

where the terms in the equation have their usual meanings as defined earlier.

EXAMPLE  12.8

The Integrated Rate Law for a Second-Order Reaction
The reaction of butadiene gas (C4H6) to yield C8H12 gas is described by the equation:

This “dimerization” reaction is second order with a rate constant equal to 5.76
conditions. If the initial concentration of butadiene is 0.200 M, what is the concentration after 10.0 min?

 10−2 L mol−1 min−1 under certain

Solution

For a second-order reaction, the integrated rate law is written

We know three variables in this equation: [A]0 = 0.200 mol/L, k = 5.76
Therefore, we can solve for [A], the fourth variable:

 10−2 L/mol/min, and t = 10.0 min.

Therefore 0.179 mol/L of butadiene remain at the end of 10.0 min, compared to the 0.200 mol/L that was originally
present.

Zero-Order Reactions

For zero-order reactions, the differential rate law is:

A zero-order reaction thus exhibits a constant reaction rate, regardless of the concentration of its reactant(s). This
may seem counterintuitive, since the reaction rate certainly can’t be finite when the reactant concentration is zero.
For purposes of this introductory text, it will suffice to note that zero-order kinetics are observed for some reactions
only under certain specific conditions. These same reactions exhibit different kinetic behaviors when the specific
conditions aren’t met, and for this reason the more prudent term pseudo-zero-order is sometimes used.

The integrated rate law for a zero-order reaction is a linear function:

A plot of [A] versus t for a zero-order reaction is a straight line with a slope of −k and a y-intercept of [A]0. Figure
12.11 shows a plot of [NH3] versus t for the thermal decomposition of ammonia at the surface of two different
heated solids. The decomposition reaction exhibits first-order behavior at a quartz (SiO2) surface, as suggested by
the exponentially decaying plot of concentration versus time. On a tungsten surface, however, the plot is linear,
indicating zero-order kinetics.

EXAMPLE  12.10

Graphical Determination of Zero-Order Rate Constant
Use the data plot in Figure 12.11 to graphically estimate the zero-order rate constant for ammonia decomposition at
a tungsten surface.

Solution

The integrated rate law for zero-order kinetics describes a linear plot of reactant concentration, [A]t, versus time, t,
with a slope equal to the negative of the rate constant, −k. Following the mathematical approach of previous
examples, the slope of the linear data plot (for decomposition on W) is estimated from the graph. Using the
ammonia concentrations at t = 0 and t = 1000 s:

The Half-Life of a Reaction

The half-life of a reaction (t1/2) is the time required for one-half of a given amount of reactant to be consumed. In
each succeeding half-life, half of the remaining concentration of the reactant is consumed. Using the decomposition
of hydrogen peroxide (Figure 12.2) as an example, we find that during the first half-life (from 0.00 hours to 6.00
hours), the concentration of H2O2 decreases from 1.000 M to 0.500 M. During the second half-life (from 6.00 hours
to 12.00 hours), it decreases from 0.500 M to 0.250 M; during the third half-life, it decreases from 0.250 M to 0.125
M. The concentration of H2O2 decreases by half during each successive period of 6.00 hours. The decomposition of
hydrogen peroxide is a first-order reaction, and, as can be shown, the half-life of a first-order reaction is
independent of the concentration of the reactant. However, half-lives of reactions with other orders depend on the
concentrations of the reactants.

First-Order Reactions
An equation relating the half-life of a first-order reaction to its rate constant may be derived from the integrated rate
law as follows:

608

12 • Kinetics

Invoking the definition of half-life, symbolized
initial concentration:

 requires that the concentration of A at this point is one-half its

Substituting these terms into the rearranged integrated rate law and simplifying yields the equation for half-life:

This equation describes an expected inverse relation between the half-life of the reaction and its rate constant, k.
Faster reactions exhibit larger rate constants and correspondingly shorter half-lives. Slower reactions exhibit
smaller rate constants and longer half-lives.
